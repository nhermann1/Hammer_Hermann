After cloning the repository to your computer, something you only have to do once per device, there is a simple process for syncing changes across all devices.

If you come to work and want to make sure you have any changes I might have added since you last worked: "git pull"
If you add a new file/edit a file/move files around: "git add -A" (the -A means all)
                                                     "git commit -m "message about what you changed" (the -m means message and it is required)
                                                     "git push"
                                                     
Hopefully this will cover what we need, but if we are starting to overwrite each other and we need multiple files/scripts we can. We can also create more complex file structures and use branches to ensure good version control, but this simple pass back and forth should work effectively. Just be sure to push all edits you make regularly.
